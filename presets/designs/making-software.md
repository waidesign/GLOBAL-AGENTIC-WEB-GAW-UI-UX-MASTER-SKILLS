# Making Software — Style Reference
> blueprint ink on a reading-room page. Set calm serif prose against labelled cobalt line drawings, typewriter mono captions, and almost no chrome at all.

**Theme:** light

Source measurements are normalized; roles and recommendations are interpreted. Font summary lists are independent, not paired by position. HTML examples are reconstructions, not source components.

Making Software is a long-form reference manual laid out like a printed technical book on a near-white Paper #fbfbfb page. One cobalt, Blueprint Blue #103dff, carries the whole identity: the pixel wordmark, the exploded isometric diagrams of floppy disks, CRTs and keyswitches, and every arrowed callout label, shaded through periwinkle and ice tints. Arizona, a bookish serif, sets justified 14px prose with a drop cap at a generous 1.6 line-height, while Departure Mono, a pixel monospace, handles uppercase chapter heads, figure numbers and captions. Chrome is almost absent: 1px hairlines, a 4px bevelled key-cap button and dotted leader lines.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Paper | `#fbfbfb` | The single page canvas behind every section, the masthead and the FAQ card; there are no tinted bands |
| Ink | `#000000` | All prose, the Table of Contents rule, chapter heads, button labels and the typewriter footer lines |
| Blueprint Blue | `#103dff` | The pixel wordmark, diagram callout labels, the progress bar and the active WORDS toggle — one cobalt reads as printed blueprint ink, not a UI accent |
| Ash Gray | `#7d7d7d` | Black at 50% for figure numbers, word counts, IN/OUT labels and the button outline — the quiet metadata layer |
| Schematic Blue | `#0043ff` | Line strokes, arrows, dashed guides and solid fills inside the technical illustrations — the working ink of every drawing |
| Periwinkle Fill | `#97acff` | Mid-tone shading on illustrated parts such as the magnetic disk and keyswitch boot — the shadow side of the cobalt |
| Cornflower Tint | `#b6c8ff` | Secondary part shading and hatched cut faces inside diagrams, one step lighter than Periwinkle Fill |
| Ice Wash | `#e6ebff` | The palest blue tint on drawn surfaces, used for lit planes of isometric objects and soft light cones |
| Diagram Mist | `#f4f5f9` | Cool off-white fill for the body of drawn objects, a half-step cooler than the page so parts read as paper cutouts |
| Hairline | `#e1e1e1` | Black at 10% for the FAQ card border and the rule between its rows; the only container edge on the page |
| White | `#ffffff` | Brightest faces of illustrated objects such as disk platters and dust liners, and the bevel highlight on the key button |

## Typography

### arizona — The reading voice for prose, the masthead lede, Table of Contents entries, FAQ answers and the Early Access block. A warm, slightly calligraphic book serif set small at 14px/400 with a 22.4px (1.6) line-height in justified columns and an airy 28px (2.0) in the chapter list; 16px/500 and 14px/600 do the heading work instead of size jumps, so hierarchy stays quiet and literary.

Zero tracking throughout; its bitmap edges echo the pixel wordmark and make captions read like a typewritten technical drawing.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Paper #fbfbfb as the only page canvas and let every section sit on it with roughly 256px of empty space between blocks.
- Set reading prose in arizona 14px/400 with 22.4px line-height, justified, in a column about 427px wide, opening with a two-line serif drop cap.
- Reserve Blueprint Blue #103dff for the pixel wordmark, diagram callout labels and active toggles; body text stays Ink #000000.
- Set chapter heads, captions and buttons in Departure Mono uppercase: 14px/400 for chapter heads, 12px/400 at 16px line-height for buttons and footer.
- Keep metadata such as FIG_001 numbers, word counts and IN/OUT labels in Ash Gray #7d7d7d Departure Mono at 10px.
- Build illustrations as isometric line drawings in Schematic Blue #0043ff shaded with Periwinkle Fill #97acff, Ice Wash #e6ebff and White, labelled with arrowed mono callouts.
- Apply the 4px radius with a 1px border only to the key button and FAQ card; leave figures and rules square at 0px.

### Don't
- Do not introduce a second brand hue; every colourful pixel on the page is a tint of Blueprint Blue #103dff.
- Do not use photography, gradients or product screenshots; imagery is hand-drawn blue technical illustration only.
- Do not set large display headings in the serif; the only big type is the pixel wordmark and headings stay at 16px/500.
- Do not fill buttons with blue; the Early Access control is a translucent white key with a 1px Ash Gray #7d7d7d border and inset bevel.
- Do not add drop shadows, cards with fills or tinted section bands; separation comes from Hairline #e1e1e1 borders and 1px Ink rules.
- Do not track Departure Mono or arizona; both run at 0px letter-spacing at every measured size.
- Do not tighten the prose leading below 22.4px at 14px or the chapter list below 28px; the airy rhythm is part of the book feel.

## Elevation

- **Bevelled Key:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75) 1px 1px 0px 2px inset, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) -1px -1px 0px 2px inset`

## Surfaces

- **Paper** (`#fbfbfb`) — The whole page canvas, masthead, figure grounds and FAQ card.
- **Diagram Mist** (`#f4f5f9`) — Body fill of drawn objects inside the technical figures.
- **Ice Wash** (`#e6ebff`) — Pale blue lit faces and light cones inside illustrations.

## Imagery

All imagery is original isometric and cutaway technical illustration drawn as SVG in a single blue family: exploded floppy disks, a cathode ray tube, a hard disk drive, a mechanical keyswitch, a pixel Aa glyph and a Gaussian surface. Strokes are thin Schematic Blue lines with dashed construction guides; volumes are shaded flatly with Periwinkle Fill, Cornflower Tint, Ice Wash and White, with diagonal hatching on cut faces. Each figure sits on a faint dotted grid with no frame or radius, a rotated FIG_00N number at its left edge and a bracketed object name and year on its right. Labels are uppercase Departure Mono with arrowed leader lines. There is no photography and no icon set; a dithered gray pixel band closes the footer.

## Layout

A single long, near-white page within a 1536px max width and 72px side margins, composed like a spread from a technical book. The masthead is a 128px band with the blue pixel wordmark at left and a two-line right-aligned serif lede, closed by a full-width row of double-dash glyphs. The opening spread is asymmetric: a narrow left column of justified prose interleaved with small figures beside one large exploded diagram filling the right two-thirds. Later blocks alternate between wide diagrams and short text columns, separated by about 256px of empty space and a centred mono MAKING SOFTWARE divider. The Table of Contents runs three columns under a 1px Ink rule, followed by a centred progress meter, a two-column FAQ, a centred Early Access block and a typewritten footer.

# Cloudflare — Style Reference
> sunrise on a blueprint. Lay crisp white engineering grids with hairline dashes, then break them open with full-bleed Cloudflare orange panels and a single white pill.

**Theme:** light

Source measurements are normalized; roles and recommendations are interpreted. Font summary lists are independent, not paired by position. HTML examples are reconstructions, not source components.

Cloudflare is a white-canvas infrastructure site drawn like a technical blueprint: a 1200px content column is fenced by 1px #f0f0f0 hairlines and dashed gutter rails, and almost everything inside is flat Paper with Graphite Ink #262626 type. That restraint lets Cloudflare Orange #ff5e1f land hard, as a 16px-rounded hero slab with a pale sunrise glow at its base, a solid orange feature panel, a pricing tab, and a closing call-to-action band. STK Bureau Sans runs the whole page at only 400 and 500, with tight -0.025em tracking on the 56px and 48px headlines, so statements read calm and engineered rather than loud; Apercu Mono Pro appears only inside agent and terminal demos. Buttons are 9999px pills, cards are near-square 3–4px boxes, and depth comes from borders, not shadows.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Cloudflare Orange | `#ff5e1f` | Hero slab, call-to-action band, sticky Start building pill, active pricing tab and the solid feature panel — one saturated orange carries the whole identity |
| Paper | `#ffffff` | Page canvas, cards and grid cells, the hero CTA pill, and all text set on orange |
| Graphite Ink | `#262626` | Headlines, navigation, body copy, footer links and line icons — a soft near-black instead of pure #000 |
| Hairline | `#f0f0f0` | Every 1px solid and dashed rule: grid cells, card frames, pill outlines, gutter rails and divider lines |
| Quiet Graphite | `#676767` | Section subheads, card descriptions and pricing subtitles; measured as Graphite Ink at 70% opacity |
| Tertiary Gray | `#727272` | Footer column headings, legal links and small helper text under prices |
| Pill Black | `#1f1f1f` | Label text on the white Start building for free pill inside orange panels |
| Ember Orange | `#ff7038` | Globe dot-map points and the View docs pill inside the orange band — a half-step lighter so it reads as orange on orange |
| Burnt Sienna | `#bf4c14` | Muted orange status text and loading dots in deploy and agent demos, where full orange would shout |
| Peach Wash | `#ffeee8` | Tinted version rows in the deploy list and mono agent-name chips — the 10% orange tint of the brand on Paper |
| Attack Crimson | `#b52831` | The Under attack? link and its shield icon in the header — the only red in the chrome |
| Alert Red | `#ed1641` | P0 incident pills in the problem collage, set on a 10% red tint |

## Typography

### STK Bureau Sans — The single voice of the page, from 56px headlines down to 13px footer headings, used only at 400 and 500. Headlines sit at 500 with 1.0 line-height and -0.025em tracking (-1.4px at 56px, -1.2px at 48px, -0.8px at 32px), so big claims stay quiet and engineered; body and nav run at 16px with 0 to -0.04px tracking.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Paper #ffffff as the canvas and frame the 1200px content column with 1px Hairline #f0f0f0 solid rules and dashed gutter rails.
- Set headlines in STK Bureau Sans 500 at 56px/56px with -1.4px tracking, and section headings at 48px/48px with -1.2px tracking.
- Reserve Cloudflare Orange #ff5e1f for full panels (16px-radius hero slab, CTA band, feature panel), the active tab and the sticky Start building pill.
- Use a Paper #ffffff 9999px pill with Pill Black #1f1f1f 16px/500 text and 12px 24px padding as the primary action on orange.
- Keep cards near-square at 3px or 4px radius with 32px padding and a 1px Hairline #f0f0f0 border instead of a shadow.
- Set supporting subheads in Quiet Graphite #676767 STK Bureau Sans 19.2px/400 with -0.48px tracking, centered under the heading.
- Apply the 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1) transition to colour, border and background changes on links, tabs and pills.

### Don't
- Do not set headlines in 600 or 700 weights; STK Bureau Sans stays at 500 even at 56px.
- Do not round cards to 12-24px; only the full-width orange hero slab and CTA band take 16px, everything else is 3-4px.
- Do not tint section backgrounds grey or cream; sections stay Paper #ffffff and are separated by Hairline #f0f0f0 rules.
- Do not use pure black for text or icons; use Graphite Ink #262626.
- Do not use Cloudflare Orange #ff5e1f as a text-link colour in body copy; it appears as fills, borders and the odd status label.
- Do not add grey drop shadows to cards; the only shadows are the white inset on orange panels and the rgba(255, 80, 10, 0.1) orange halo.
- Do not use Apercu Mono Pro for eyebrows or labels; keep it inside terminal and agent demos at 12px.

## Elevation

- **Orange Glass Panel:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 1px 6px 6px 0px inset, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35) 0px 0px 0px 0px inset, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02) 0px 4px 12px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02) 0px 0px 0px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03) 0px 2px 12px 0px`
- **Ember Halo Card:** `rgba(255, 80, 10, 0.1) 0px 4px 100px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02) 0px 0px 32px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03) 0px 2px 12px 0px`

## Surfaces

- **Paper** (`#ffffff`) — Page canvas, header, grid cells, cards and pricing columns.
- **Peach Wash** (`#ffeee8`) — Tinted deploy rows and mono agent chips inside demo cards.
- **Cloudflare Orange** (`#ff5e1f`) — Hero slab, feature panel, active tab and closing CTA band.
- **Ember Orange** (`#ff7038`) — Secondary pills and raised tiles set on orange panels.

## Imagery

There is no photography. The hero is a looping background video of a dotted, scan-line orange field with a soft pale-yellow sunrise glowing up from its bottom edge, and the closing band reuses it with tilted translucent icon tiles floating in the orange. In the white sections, imagery is diagrammatic: a dotted globe in Ember Orange with circular user and database nodes, an orange-bracketed dashed callout, faded incident-ticket collages with P0 pills, and live-looking UI fragments such as a deploy list with Peach Wash rows and an agent terminal in Apercu Mono Pro. Icons are thin Graphite Ink line glyphs; customer logos run in full colour in a marquee.

## Layout

The page sits inside a 1480px frame whose outer gutters are drawn with dashed Hairline rails,, around a 1200px content column outlined by 1px Hairline rules so each section reads as a blueprint cell. A 72px white header centers four 16px/500 menu links and collapses on scroll to the logo plus an orange Start building pill. The hero is a 16px-rounded Cloudflare Orange slab spanning the full frame, centering an announcement pill, a two-line 56px white headline, a lede and one white pill. Below, every section repeats the same centered pattern: a 48px heading, a Quiet Graphite subhead, then a hairline-ruled module (three-column feature cells, a tabbed testimonial, a split white/orange comparison, a four-column pricing grid, an uneven bento of deploy and agent demos). The page closes with a second full-width orange band carrying two pills and a scrolling orange ticker, then a four-column link footer.
